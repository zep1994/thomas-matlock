            My name is Thomas Matlock, and I am a results-driven full-stack developer specializing in creating scalable, high-performance applications using .NET, C#, JavaScript, React, Angular, and SQL. After venturing into entrepreneurship during my studies at Ole Miss, I deepened my technical skills through a scholarship at Flatiron School, and later worked professionally in both New York City and at Ergon in Mississippi.
            <br /><br />
            At Ergon, I developed enterprise-wide applications that streamlined critical business operations, improved user experience, and significantly reduced manual workloads by automating processes. I spearheaded the development of a Python-based analytics system to audit and analyze millions of SAP records, effectively identifying discrepancies and recovering substantial revenue annually. Additionally, I implemented workflow automation tools that increased processing speeds and reduced daily manual tasks.
            <br /><br />
            My combination of technical acumen and strong auditing practices (as a Certified Information Systems Auditor - CISA) enables me to deliver impactful solutions and foster productive team relationships.
